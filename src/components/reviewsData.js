      text: "My daughter studied in this school. The school atmosphere is neat and kid friendly. The concepts are taught such that the kids can easily understand. Apart from academics, importance is given for extracurricular activities too. Kids are encouraged to talk in front of the class which helps in public speaking. Special occasions are celebrated with many fun activities, crafts, singing etc.Kudos to all the teachers especially Reena mam. We can trust our kids with them. She treats all students like her kids. My daughter wants to become a teacher inspired by her.",
